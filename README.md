# JKMP22-Replication
Replicates the main results in Jensen, Kelly, Malamud &amp; Pedersen - Machine Learning and the Implementable Efficient Frontier based on their Working Paper from 2022. I restrict the sample to the stocks in the S&P500 at each point in time. Requires access to the global factors data provided by Jensen, Kelly & Pedersen (2023). Moreover, requires access to CRSP or other providers for daily stock return data.
